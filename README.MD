# Installation

## Step 1: clone the repository, install python and dependencies 
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) and add it to PATH

- Clone the repository - [Download zip](https://github.com/Sclafus/twitch-chatbot-for-gosumemory/archive/refs/heads/senpai.zip)

- Open a terminal and type:
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or 
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
to install the required libraries

## Step 2: create a new twitch app
- Login on [Twitch Developers](https://dev.twitch.tv/)
- Register a [new Twitch Application](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps). Choose a name (eg. "Osu Chatbot") and set your URL to `https://127.0.0.1`. The category should be "Chat Bot".
- Copy the `Client ID`, it will be needed in [Step 3](#step-3-create-env)

- Open your browser in incognito mode and visit [twitchapps](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/) to get your oauth token. You will need to login with your bot account, not your main account.
- Copy the oauth token

## Step 3: create .env
- Create a .env file with the following content:

```bash

# Twitch config
TMI_TOKEN = ####################               # starts with "oauth:"
CLIENT_ID = ##################
BOT_NICK = your_chatbot_username
BOT_PREFIX = !
CHANNEL = your_channel_username
GOSUMEMORY_JSON_URL = http://127.0.0.1:24050/json # probably this

# Mega config
MEGA_EMAIL = example@email.com
MEGA_PASSWORD = yourpassword                   # not very secure, I know...
                                               # also 2FA is not supported
MEGA_FOLDER = folder/subfolder
```

## Step 4: play more
- Execute `python twitch_chatbot.py` in the terminal or simply double click it
